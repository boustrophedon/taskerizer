current todo:
- implement subcommand::run for list

implement database operations:
	- decide which operation to implement next
		- Break: set break probability
		- Current: display current task
		- Complete: mark task as complete
		- Skip: skip current task
	- write test for that operation
	- implement operation
	- refactor, iterate

improve display in list command:
	- align columns
		- format should be able to do this?
		- probably cut off for overflow because we will still show the whole task in `current` command anyway

test and implement config parsing:
	- pick config dir and file
	- Default::default impl if failure to read or file does not exist
	- maybe add command line options at some point to select directory
	- deserialize config

write more tests for failure conditions:
	- Empty string for add
	- corrupt db?
	- bad permissions on db directory
	- bad permissions on config directory once config is implemented
