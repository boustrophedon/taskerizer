current todo:
- write test for dispatch list

implement database operations:
	- decide which operation to implement next
	- write test for that operation
	- implement operation
	- refactor, iterate

test and implement config parsing:
	- pick config dir and file
	- Default::default impl if failure to read or file does not exist
	- maybe add command line options at some point to select directory
	- deserialize config

write more tests for failure conditions:
	- corrupt db?
	- bad permissions on db directory
	- bad permissions on config directory once config is implemented
