current todo:
- change main to simply print out list of strings returned by dispatch (i.e. it's a render function which just renders a list of strings)
- write test for dispatch on add and list
- change command.dispatch to return a list of strings
	- this makes command.dispatch testable

implement database operations:
	- decide which operation to implement next
	- write test for that operation
	- implement operation
	- refactor, iterate

test and implement config parsing:
	- pick config dir and file
	- Default::default impl if failure to read or file does not exist
	- maybe add command line options at some point to select directory
	- deserialize config
