implement database operations:
	- decide which operation to implement next
	- write test for that operation
	- implement operation
	- refactor, iterate

decide how to test actual dispatched actions:
	- it might be enough to not test those if they're thin enough wrappers around the db ops
	- otherwise test by reading input/output, there are crates for this i think
